        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Chris Larsen, a software developer with a focus on web and IoT technologies.</p>
        <p>My main stack for web development is Ruby on Rails, with VueJS on the front end. My IoT projects are mostly done with Ruby and C. The hardware for my IoT projects is usually Raspberry Pi, but I also work with other platforms.</p>
        <p>On this site, you'll find information about current projects that I'm working on, and some of my professional work.</p>
